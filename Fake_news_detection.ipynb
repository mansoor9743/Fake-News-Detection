    "> Earlier we did stemming of the 'statements' in the LIAR dataset using NLTK porter stemmer. Now we use stemming.The aim of both is the similar that is to reduce the inflectional forms of each word into a common base or root. Lemmatization is closely related to stemming, However the difference is that a stemmer operates on a single word without knowledge of the context, and therefore cannot discriminate between words which have different meanings depending on part of speech. Here we provide POS (parts of speech tagging) as the context for lemmatisation. Stemmers are typically easier to implement and run faster but have reduced accuracy.\n"
