Project Title: Fake News Detection

Getting started: 

Download the 'Fake_news_detection.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook file and the data into a folder on your system. Unzip the contents of the data zip file. It consists of 3 TSV (tab separated) files. From terminal CD into the folder and launch Jupyter notebook. You can view the results of the code already run by me in the notebook. To rerun the code run 'restart and run all' from the notebook. The entire notebook will take approximately 80 minutes to execute.

Prerequisites: 

Sklearn, NLTK and other libraries lumpy, pandas, seaborn etc needs to be installed if not already done.They are called in the initial line of the code. NLTK 'stopwords', NLTK('punkt'),NLTK ('maxent_treebank_pos_tagger') needs to be downloaded.
All the classifiers used are available when Sklearn is installed, except XGradientBoost Algorithm.
For installing XGradientBoost algorithm classifier please refer 'https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html'.
Note: A simple 'pip3 install xgboost' will install it most of the times. If not then please refer the above link.
